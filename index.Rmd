## Question 1:

##### Load the package nycflights13 with library(nycflights13). If you are not on the servers, you will need to install this package before you can use it! 

##### Run the included code chunk below to save flights and airports to your environment.

```{R}
# install.packages("nycflights13")
library(nycflights13)
library(tidyverse)

flights<-flights
airports<-airports
airlines<-airlines
```

##### Explore the `flights` dataset (e.g., run `glimpse(flights)` read the description of each variable in the help by running `?flights`). Notice how many rows/observations there are: That's how many flights left the three big NYC airports in 2013!

### 1.1 (2 pts) 

##### Report the number and proportion of NAs for each variable using summarize_all() and/or mutate_all(). Ideally, you will write your own short function(s) to count NAs and apply it to every column via `summarize_all`, but there are other ways.

```{R}
flights %>% summarise_all(function(x)sum(is.na(x)))
```


### 1.2 (2 pts) 

##### Remove all rows containing NAs from the dataset (**for the rest of the assignment, we will be using only the complete rows, so overwrite the `flights` dataset or save it as a new object and use it in place of `flights` from here on out**). Now, using filter, what airport `dest`ination (three-letter code fine) has the longest `air_time`? 

```{R}
flights <- flights %>% na.omit()
flights %>% group_by(dest) %>% summarise(mean_airtime = mean(air_time)) %>% arrange(desc(mean_airtime))
```


### 1.3 (4 pts) 

##### Find the mean, standard deviation, count, and standard error of `distance` in each month (i.e., averaged across `day`) for flights from the three different New York airports (`origin`). You will use your sd and count to find your se=sd/sqrt(count). Rename your summary variables inside of `summarize()`. 

```{R}
flights %>% group_by(month, origin) %>% summarise(mean_dist = mean(distance), num_dist = n(), sd_dist = sd(distance), se = sd_dist/sqrt(num_dist))
```

### 1.4 (4 pts) 

##### Using your results from part 1.3, make a barplot of mean distance for each month using `ggplot()`. Add manual standard error bars using geom_errorbar() by specifying `aes(x=month, y=your_mean, ymin=your_mean-your_se, ymax=your_mean+your_se)`. Facet (or equivalent) by `origin` and provide labels/ticks on the x-axis for each month. Write a bit about what you see!

```{R}
flights %>% group_by(month, origin) %>% summarise(mean_dist = mean(distance), num_dist = n(), sd_dist = sd(distance), se = sd_dist/sqrt(num_dist)) %>% ggplot(aes(x = month, y = mean_dist)) + geom_bar(stat = "identity") + facet_grid(~origin) + xlab("Month") + ylab("Average Distance") + scale_x_continuous(n.breaks = 12) + geom_errorbar(aes(x = month, y = mean_dist, ymin = mean_dist - se, ymax = mean_dist + se))
```


*The average distance travelled throughout the year is consistent within each airport. However, the average distance traveled at JFK is higher than EWR and LGA. The standard error is also smaller at LGA.*

## Question 2 (2 pts)

Let's do some joining! The dataset `airlines` contains the full name of the carrier (examine it!). Join the dataset with the flights dataset so all of the information in `flights` is retained. Using the merged dataset, which carrier (`name`) has the longest average departure delay? Which has the shortest?

```{R}
joined_airlines_flights <- left_join(flights, airlines, by = "carrier")
joined_airlines_flights %>% group_by(name) %>% summarise(mean_dep_delay = mean(dep_delay)) %>% arrange(mean_dep_delay)
```


*Frontier has the longest average departure delay and US Airways has the shortest average departure delay.*


## Question 3 


### 3.1 (4 pts) 

##### Look at the dataset called `airports`. How many rows does it have? How many unique airports (variable `faa`)? Using methods we have seen/discussed (e.g., `%in%` with `sum()` or `mean()`, set operations, joins), how many of these airports (variable `faa`) appear in the `flights` dataset as destinations (variable `dest`)? How many unique destination airports are there in the flights dataset? Which destination airports are in the `flights` dataset but missing from the `airports` dataset? Google those airport codes: what do they have in common?

```{R}
count(airports)
airports %>% summarize_all(n_distinct) %>% pull(faa)
distinct_airports <- airports %>% distinct(faa)
distinct_flights <- flights %>% distinct(dest)
count(semi_join(distinct_airports, distinct_flights, by = c("faa" = "dest")))
flights %>% summarize_all(n_distinct) %>% pull(dest)
anti_join(distinct_flights, distinct_airports, by = c("dest" = "faa"))
```

*There are 1458 rows in the airports dataset. There are 1458 unique airports in the airports dataset. 100 of the airports in the airports dataset appears in the flights dataset. There are 104 unique destinations in the flights dataset. BQN, SJU, STT, and PSE appear in the flights dataset, but not in the airports dataset. Three of those were in Puerto Rico and one of those were in the Virgin Islands. The common factor is that these are overseas US territories.*

### 3.2 (2 pts) 

##### Do a join that results in a dataset that contains only the rows with matches (i.e., none of the airports not appearing in `flights`, none of the destinations not appearing in `airports`). Call `glimpse()` on this final dataset (please don't print the whole thing out).

```{R}
semi_join(distinct_airports, distinct_flights, by = c("faa" = "dest")) %>% glimpse
```
